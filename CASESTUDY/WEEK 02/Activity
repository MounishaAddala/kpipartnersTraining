2nd NF :-
2NF allows non-prime attributes to be functionally dependent on non-prime attributes

3rd NF :-
1. In 3NF non-prime attributes are only allowed to be functionally dependent on Super key of relation.
2.when a table is in 3NF it is in 2NF and 3NF is stricter than 2NF
Example of 2nf :
Suppose a school wants to store the data of teachers and the subjects they teach. They create a table that looks like this: Since a teacher can teach more than one subjects, the table can have multiple rows for a same teacher.
Teacher id	Subject	Teacher age
111	Maths	38
111	Physics	38
222	Biology	38
333	Physics	40
333	Chemistry	40

Candidate Keys: {teacher_id, subject}
Non prime attribute: teacher_age
However, it is not in 2NF because non prime attribute teacher_age is dependent on teacher_id alone which is a proper subset of candidate key. This violates the rule for 2NF as the rule says “no non-prime attribute is dependent on the proper subset of any candidate key of the table”
To make the table complies with 2NF we can break it in two tables like this:-
teacher_details table:-
Teacher_id	Teacher_age
111	38
222	38
333	40

teacher_subject table:-
Teacher_id	Subject
111	Maths
111	Physics
222	Biology
333	Physics
333	Chemistry

3rd Nf Example :-
  1.Table must be in 2NF
2.Transitive functional dependency of non-prime attribute on any super key should be removed
•	X is a super key of table
•	Y is a prime attribute of table
Suppose a company wants to store the complete address of each employee, they create a table named employee_details that looks like this:
Emp_id	Emp_name	Emp_Zip	Emp_state	Emp_city	Emp_dist
1001	John	282005	UP	AGRA	Dayal Bagh
1002	Ajit	222008	TN	CHENNAI	M-city
1006	Lora	282007	TN	CHENNAI	Urrapakkam
1101	Lilly	292008	UK	PAURI	Bhagwan
1201	Steve	222999	MP	GWALIOR	ratan

Super keys: {emp_id}, {emp_id, emp_name}, {emp_id, emp_name, emp_zip}…so on
Candidate Keys: {emp_id}
Non-prime attributes: all attributes except emp_id are non-prime as they are not part of any candidate keys
Here, emp_state, emp_city & emp_district dependent on emp_zip. And, emp_zip is dependent on emp_id that makes non-prime attributes (emp_state, emp_city & emp_district) transitively dependent on super key (emp_id). This violates the rule of 3NF.
To make this table complies with 3NF we have to break the table into two tables to remove the transitive dependency:
employee table:-
Emp_id	Emp_name	Emp_zip
1001	John	282005
1002	Ajeet	222008
1006	Lora	282007
1101	Lilly	292008
1201	Steve	222999


employee_zip table:-
Emp_zip	Emp_state	Emp_city	Emp_dist
282005	UP	AGRA	Dalyal Bagh
222008	TN	CHENNAI	M-city
282007	TN	CHENNAI	Urrapakkam
292008	UK	PAURI	Bhagwan
222999	MP	GWALIOR	Ratan
